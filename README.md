# Joomla Day New England 2012 Template Workshop
Code repository for the Joomla! Day New England 2012 Template Workshop - http://www.joomladaynewengland.org/template-workshop

Designed to introduce the fundamental basics of what a Joomla! template needs, by converting a simple HTML mock-up. We will then progressively develop this template to include additional basic features and functionality, all the while explaining the various aspects of the code to empower you with the foundational knowledge you need to take this adventure into whatever direction you decide to go in.

## <a href="https://github.com/betweenbrain/Joomla-Day-New-England/tree/master/step-1">/step-1</a>
Is based mostly on Dan Cederhorn's Bulletproof Web Design Example Code: The Bulletproof Pretzel Company
From http://www.simplebits.com/publications/bulletproof/code/

## <a href="https://github.com/betweenbrain/Joomla-Day-New-England/tree/master/step-2">/step-2</a>
Basic, functional template based on the HTML mock-up. While somewhat limited, this implementation illustrates the bare essentials required by Joomla.

	- Uses Joomla 2.5's sample data, position-7 populates the right-hand menus, position-1 populates the top navigation, position-12 can be populated by a Custom HTML module, and the component replaces the static sample content.

## <a href="https://github.com/betweenbrain/Joomla-Day-New-England/tree/master/step-3">/step-3</a>
Slight improvement of the basic implementation including module chrome and the very useful `<jdoc:include type="message" />`

	- Adds module chrome `xhtml` to allow using the "box" module class suffix

## <a href="https://github.com/betweenbrain/Joomla-Day-New-England/tree/master/step-4">/step-4</a>
Further development of the template to include more functionality such as collapsible module positions/containing elements as well as techniques for using Joomla's to link stylesheets, JajaScript and other head elements.

## <a href="https://github.com/betweenbrain/Joomla-Day-New-England/tree/master/step-5">/step-5</a>
More advanced development of the template to include dynamically adding body classes, template parameters, external PHP files.
