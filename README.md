# Joomla Day New England 2012 Template Workshop
Code repository for the Joomla! Day New England 2012 Template Workshop - http://www.joomladaynewengland.org/template-workshop

Designed to introduce the fundamental basics of what a Joomla! template needs, by converting a simple HTML mock-up. We will then progressivly develop this template to include additonal basic features and functionality, all the while explaining the various asects of the code to empower you with the fundational knowledge you need to take this adventure into whatever direction you decide to go in.

## /step-1
Is Dan Cederhorn's Bulletproof Web Design Example Code: The Bulletproof Pretzel Company
From http://www.simplebits.com/publications/bulletproof/code/

## /step-2
Basic, functional template based on the HTML mock-up. While somewhat limited, this implementation illustrates the bare essentials required by Joomla.

## /step-3
Slight improvement of the basic implementation including module chrome and the very useful `<jdoc:include type="message" />`
	- Uses module chrome `xhtml` to allow using the "box" module class suffix

## /step-4
Further development of the template to include more functionality such as collapsible module positions/containing elements as well as techniques for using Joomla's to link stylesheets, JajaScript and other head elements.

## /step-5
More advanced development of the template to include dynamically adding body classes, template parameters, external PHP files.
